# MagicAI
I worked on the source code from MagicAI and noticed that it lacks a modular structure, making it difficult to maintain and follow. Therefore, I spent time restructuring it into a modular format based on internachi/modular. This approach allows for easier maintenance and the ability to extend features and improve performance significantly.

```bash
composer require internachi/modular
```
